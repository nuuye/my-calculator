# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a replica of the classic Windows Calculator built using React.js. The goal of this project was to create a functional and visually similar version of the original calculator using modern web development technologies.

The calculator features all the basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions. The user interface has been designed to closely match the original calculator, with a simple and easy-to-use layout.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
